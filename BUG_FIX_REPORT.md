# Print Area Configuration - Bug Fix Report

## Date: October 14, 2025

## Overview
Fixed two critical bugs in the Print Area Configuration system that were preventing users from saving configurations after deleting print areas and uploading new product template images.

---

## Bug #1: Save Configuration Error After Deleting Print Areas

### **Problem Description**
When deleting a print area (e.g., the "Back" template for a tote bag) and clicking "Save", the system threw an error:
```
Failed to save configuration: JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned
```

### **Root Cause**
The `getProductTemplate()` function in `supabaseService.js` was throwing an error when no product template existed in the database. This happened because:

1. The product was loaded from `products.json` (local config file)
2. It hadn't been saved to the Supabase database yet
3. When saving, the function tried to fetch the template with `.single()`
4. The `.single()` method threw an error when no rows were found
5. The error propagated up and caused the save to fail

The `saveProductConfiguration()` function expected `getProductTemplate()` to return `null` when no template was found, but instead it was throwing an error.

### **Solution**
Modified `getProductTemplate()` to catch the "no rows found" error and return `null` instead of throwing:

```javascript
if (error) {
  // If no rows found, return null instead of throwing
  if (error.code === 'PGRST116' || error.message.includes('no rows')) {
    console.log('[getProductTemplate] No template found for:', productKey);
    return null;
  }
  throw error;
}
```

**File Changed:** `src/services/supabaseService.js` (lines 137-144)

### **Impact**
- Users can now save configurations for products that haven't been saved to the database yet
- Deleting print areas and saving works correctly
- First-time saves create new database records as expected

## Bug #2: Template Image Upload Not Displaying

### **Problem Description**
When uploading a new product template image to replace the default template:
1. The upload appeared to succeed
2. Success message was displayed
3. However, the canvas continued showing the old template image
4. The new image was not visible in the editor

### **Root Cause**
The `loadProduct()` function was using stale data from the `productsConfig` prop instead of the updated `currentProduct` state:

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Bug
const product = productsConfig[selectedProduct];  // Uses prop (stale data)
setCurrentProduct(product);  // Overwrites state with old data
```

When a template was uploaded:
1. `handleTemplateUpload()` updated `currentProduct` state with new template URL
2. `loadProduct()` was called to refresh the canvas
3. But `loadProduct()` immediately overwrote the state with old data from `productsConfig`
4. The old template URL was used to load the image

### **Solution**
Modified `loadProduct()` to use the `currentProduct` state instead of the `productsConfig` prop:

```javascript
// NEW CODE - Fixed
// Use currentProduct state instead of productsConfig prop
// This ensures we use the latest data, including newly uploaded template URLs
console.log('[PrintAreaAdmin] Using current product:', currentProduct);
```

Also improved template URL handling to support Supabase Storage URLs:

```javascript
const fixedTemplateUrl = templateUrl.startsWith('http') ? templateUrl : 
                         (templateUrl.startsWith('/') ? templateUrl : `/${templateUrl}`);
```

Additionally, simplified `handleTemplateUpload()` by removing the manual `loadProduct()` call, letting the useEffect handle the refresh automatically when `currentProduct` changes.

**Files Changed:** 
- `src/components/PrintAreaAdmin.jsx` (lines 182-206, 604-614)

### **Impact**
- Uploaded template images now display immediately in the canvas
- Both local file paths and Supabase Storage URLs work correctly
- The canvas refreshes automatically when the template is updated
- Cleaner code with better state management

## Testing Instructions

### **Test Bug #1 Fix: Save After Deleting Print Area**

1. **Setup:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173/enhanced-designer
   - Sign in as admin
   - Select "Tote Bag" from the product dropdown
   - Click the settings icon to open Print Area Configuration

2. **Test Steps:**
   - Delete the "Back" print area by clicking the trash icon
   - Click the "Save" button
   - Observe the result

3. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ Configuration saves successfully
   - ✅ Success message: "Configuration saved successfully to database!"
   - ✅ No error messages appear
   - ✅ The print area is removed from the database

4. **Verification:**
   - Close the configuration modal
   - Reopen it for the same product
   - Confirm the "Back" print area is gone
   - The "Front" print area should still be present

### **Test Bug #2 Fix: Template Image Upload**

1. **Setup:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173/enhanced-designer
   - Sign in as admin
   - Select "Tote Bag" from the product dropdown
   - Click the settings icon to open Print Area Configuration

2. **Test Steps:**
   - Click the purple "Template" button
   - Select a new product template image (any PNG/JPG image)
   - Wait for the upload to complete
   - Observe the canvas

3. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ Success message: "Template image uploaded successfully! Canvas will refresh automatically."
   - ✅ The canvas displays the NEW template image immediately
   - ✅ Print areas overlay correctly on the new template
   - ✅ The image is properly centered and scaled

4. **Verification:**
   - Click "Save" to persist the new template
   - Close the configuration modal
   - Reopen it for the same product
   - Confirm the new template is loaded from the database
   - The template should persist across page refreshes

### **Combined Test: Upload + Delete + Save**

1. **Test Steps:**
   - Upload a new template image
   - Wait for the canvas to refresh
   - Delete a print area (e.g., "Back")
   - Click "Save"
   - Close and reopen the configuration

2. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ All changes persist correctly
   - ✅ New template is visible
   - ✅ Deleted print area is gone
   - ✅ No errors during any step
