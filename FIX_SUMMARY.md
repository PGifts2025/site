## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### **Bug #1: Save Configuration Error**
- **Issue:** `JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned` error when saving after deleting print areas
- **Root Cause:** `getProductTemplate()` was throwing error instead of returning null when template not found
- **Fix:** Added error handling to return null for "no rows found" case
- **File:** `src/services/supabaseService.js` (lines 137-144)

### **Bug #2: Template Upload Not Displaying**
- **Issue:** Newly uploaded template images didn't display in the editor canvas
- **Root Cause:** `loadProduct()` was using stale data from props instead of updated state
- **Fix:** Modified to use `currentProduct` state and improved URL handling for Supabase Storage
- **Files:** `src/components/PrintAreaAdmin.jsx` (lines 182-206, 604-614)
