# Print Area Configuration - Comprehensive Test Report

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Product Tested:** Tote Bag Template  
**Bug Fixed:** Print area rectangles stuck to cursor after dragging

---

## 🐛 Bug Description
**Issue:** Print area rectangles would stick to the cursor after dragging and wouldn't release, making the interface unusable.

**Root Cause:** Missing event handlers for `object:moving` and `mouse:up` events in Fabric.js canvas. The drag operation wasn't properly completing, leaving objects in a "moving" state.

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Changes Made to `src/components/PrintAreaAdmin.jsx`:

1. **Added `handleObjectMoving` function** (lines 290-314)
   - Updates label position during drag
   - Implements snap-to-grid functionality
   - Includes null check for canvas safety

2. **Added `handleMouseUp` function** (lines 345-354)
   - Ensures objects are properly released after drag
   - Forces canvas re-render to correct state

3. **Updated event listeners** (lines 68-74)
   - Added `object:moving` event listener
   - Added `mouse:up` event listener

4. **Updated cleanup** (lines 87-92)
   - Properly removes all event listeners on unmount
   - Prevents memory leaks
